# Mutation Analysis Data Pipeline

This project is a **bioinformatics-inspired data engineering pipeline** that identifies potentially harmful gene mutations. It is designed as a modular system with **data ingestion, transformation, mutation flagging, and dashboard visualization**, orchestrated through **Apache Airflow** and supported by a **PostgreSQL database** and a **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## Features

- **Automated ETL pipeline** using Apache Airflow
- **Mutation analysis logic** to flag deleterious variants
- **PostgreSQL database** for storing alerts
- **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive exploration
- Fully containerized with **Docker**
- Basic testing and logging included

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. **Ingestion**
- Loads mutation data from local files (e.g. `ccle_mutations.csv`)
- Scheduled and managed via Airflow (`ingest_dag.py`)

### 2. **Transformation**
- Filters relevant columns (e.g. `Hugo_Symbol`, `Variant_Type`, `isDeleterious`)
- Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis

### 3. **Mutation Analysis**
- Applies rule-based logic to flag potentially harmful mutations
- Outputs a mutation alert CSV and stores it in PostgreSQL

### 4. **Dashboard**
- Streamlit app allows users to:
  - Explore flagged mutations
  - Filter by gene, mutation type, etc.
  - View alert statistics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Basic familiarity with Airflow and Python

### Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/evmten/mutation-pipeline.git
cd mutation-pipeline

# Start the pipeline
docker-compose up --build
```
#### Then:
- Visit Airflow: http://localhost:8080

- Visit Streamlit Dashboard: http://localhost:8501

#### Example Use Case
This pipeline could be adapted for:

- Flagging mutations in cancer-related datasets

- Running nightly mutation scans on fresh genomic data

- Integrating with external APIs or research dashboards

#### Future Improvements
- Add more complex mutation-scoring logic

- Expand the dashboard to show mutation pathways or gene interactions

- Integrate with real-time genomics APIs (e.g., COSMIC, Ensembl)

- Include advanced alerting (e.g., email or Slack)
